        "(Optional; PDF 1.4) The constant opacity value that is used in painting the annotation (see Sections 11.2, “Overview of Transparency,” and 11.3.7, “Shape and Opacity Computations”). This value applies to all visible elements of the annotation in its closed state (including its background and border) but not to the pop-up window that appears when the annotation is opened.\nThe specified value shall not used if the annotation has an appearance stream (see 12.5.5, “Appearance Streams”); in that case, the appearance stream shall specify any transparency. (However, if the compliant viewer regenerates the annotation’s appearance stream, it may incorporate the CA value into the stream’s content.)\nThe implicit blend mode (see 11.3.5, “Blend Mode” ”) is Normal. Default value: 1.0.\nIf no explicit appearance stream is defined for the annotation, it may bepainted by implementation-dependent means that do not necessarily conform to the PDF imaging model; in this case, the effect of this entry is implementation-dependent as well."

The relationship between the two annotations is specified by the RT entry.\nIf this entry is present in an FDF file (see 12.7.7, “Forms Data Format”), its type is not a dictionary but a text string containing the contents of the NM entry of the annotation being replied to, to allow for a situation where the annotation being replied to is not in the same FDF file."

Valid values are:\nRThe annotation is considered a reply to the annotation specified by IRT. Conforming readers shall not display replies to an annotation individually but together in the form of threaded comments.\nGroupThe annotation is grouped with the annotation specified by IRT; see the discussion following this Table.\nDefault value: R."

Intents allow conforming readers to distinguish between different uses and behaviors of a single markup annotation type. If this entry is not present or its value is the same as the annotation type, the annotation has no explicit intent and behaves in a generic manner in a conforming reader.\nFree text annotations (Table 174), line annotations (Table 175), polygon annotations (Table 178), and (PDF 1.7) polyline annotations (Table 178) have defined intents, whose values are enumerated in the corresponding tables."
