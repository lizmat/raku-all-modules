However, this entry is present in the group attributes dictionary for any transparency group XObject that has no parent group or page from which to inherit—in particular, one that is the value of the G entry in a soft-mask dictionary of subtype Luminosity (see Additionally, the CS entry may be present in the group attributes dictionary associated with a page object, even if I is false or absent. In the normal case in which the page is imposed directly on the output medium, the page group is effectively isolated regardless of the I value, and the specified CS value shall therefore be honoured. But if the page is in turn used as an element of some other page and if the group is non-isolated, CS is ignored and the colour space is inherited from the actual backdrop with which the page is composited (see Default value: the colour space of the parent group or page into which this transparency group is painted.

In the normal case in which the page is imposed directly on the output medium, the page group is effectively isolated and the specified I value is ignored. But if the page is in turn used as an element of some other page, it is treated as if it were a transparency group XObject; the I value is interpreted in the normal way to determine whether the page group is isolated."
