Each nested array may optionally have as its first element a text string to be used as a non-selectable label in a conforming reader’s user interface.\nText labels in nested arrays is used to present collections of related optional content groups, and not to communicate actual nesting of content inside multiple layers of groups (see Link EXAMPLE 1 in 8.11.4.3, \"Optional Content Configuration Dictionaries\"). To reflect actual nesting of groups in the content, such as for layers with sublayers, nested arrays of groups without a text label is used (see Link EXAMPLE 2 in 8.11.4.3, \"Optional Content Configuration Dictionaries\").\nAn empty array [] explicitly specifies that no groups shall bepresented.\nIn the default configuration dictionary, the default value is an empty array; in other configuration dictionaries, the default is the Order value from the default configuration dictionary.\nAny groups not listed in this array is not presented in any user interface that uses the configuration."

However, turning a group from ON to OFF does not force any other group to be turned ON.\nAn empty array [] explicitly indicates that no such collections exist.\nIn the default configuration dictionary, the default value is an empty array; in other configuration dictionaries, the default is the RBGroups value from the default configuration dictionary."

Conforming writers can use this entry to prevent the visibility of content that depends on these groups from being changed by users.\nDefault value: an empty array.\nA conforming reader may allow the states of optional content groups from being changed by means other than the user interface, such as JavaScript or items in the AS entry of a configuration dictionary."
