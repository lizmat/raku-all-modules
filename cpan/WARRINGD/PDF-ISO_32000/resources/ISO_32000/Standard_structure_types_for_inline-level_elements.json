        "Span",
        "(Span) A generic inline portion of text having no particular inherent characteristics. It can be used, for example, to delimit a range of text with a given set of styling attributes.\nNOTE 1 Not all inline style changes need to be identified as a span. Text colour and font changes (including modifiers such as bold, italic, and small caps) need not be so marked, since these can be derived from the PDF content (see Link “Font Characteristics” in 14.8.2.4, “Extraction of Character Properties”). However, it is necessary to use a span to apply explicit layout attributes such as LineHeight, BaselineShift, or TextDecorationType (see Link “Layout Attributes for ILSEs” in 14.8.5.4, “Layout Attributes”).\nNOTE 2 Marked-content sequences having the tag Span are also used to carry certain accessibility properties (Alt, ActualText, Lang, and E; see 14.9, “Accessibility Support”). Such sequences lack an MCID property and are not associated with any structure element. This use of the Span marked-content tag is distinct from its use as a structure type."

        "Quote",
        "(Quotation) An inline portion of text attributed to someone other than the author of the surrounding text.\nThe quoted text is contained inline within a single paragraph. This differs from the block-level element BlockQuote (see 14.8.4.2, “Grouping Elements”), which consists of one or more complete paragraphs (or other elements presented as if they were complete paragraphs)."

        "Note",
        "(Note) An item of explanatory text, such as a footnote or an endnote, that is referred to from within the body of the document. It may have a label (structure type Lbl; see Link “List Elements” in 14.8.4.3, “Block-Level Structure Elements”) as a child. The note may be included as a child of the structure element in the body text that refers to it, or it may be included elsewhere (such as in an endnotes section) and accessed by means of a reference (structure type Reference).\nTagged PDF does not prescribe the placement of footnotes in the page content order. They may be either inline or at the end of the page, at the discretion of theconforming writer."
