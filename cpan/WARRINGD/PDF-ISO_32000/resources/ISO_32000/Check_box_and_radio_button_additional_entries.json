Each entry is a text string representing the on state of the corresponding widget annotation.\nWhen this entry is present, the names used to represent the on state in the APdictionary of each annotation (for example, /1, /2) numerical position (starting with 0) of the annotation in the Kids array, encoded as a name object. This allows distinguishing between the annotations even if two or more of them have the same value in the Opt array."
