If human-readable, this string may be used in lieu of an OutputCondition string for presentation to the user.\nA typical value for this entry may be the name of a production condition maintained in an industry-standard registry such as the ICC Characterization Data Registry (see the Bibliography). If the designated condition matches that in effect at production time, the production software is responsible for providing the corresponding ICC profile as defined in the registry.\nIf the intended production condition is not a recognized standard, the value of this entry may be Custom or an application-specific, machine-readable name. The DestOutputProfile entry defines the ICC profile, and the Info entry is used for further human-readable identification."

The output transformation uses the profile’s “from CIE” information (BToA in ICC terminology); the “to CIE” (AToB) information may optionally be used to remap source colour values to some other destination colour space, such as for screen preview or hardcopy proofing."
