        "(Optional) A signature dictionary that is used to specify and validate additional capabilities (usage rights) granted for this document; that is, the enabling of interactive features of the conforming reader that are not available by default.\nFor example, A conforming reader does not permit saving documents by default, but an agent may grant permissions that enable saving specific documents. The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by the agent that did the signing.\nThe signature dictionary shall contain a Reference entry that is a signature reference dictionary that has a UR transform method (see 12.8.2.3, “UR”). The transform parameter dictionary for this method indicates which additional permissions is granted for the document. If the signature is valid, the conforming reader shall allow the specified permissions for the document, in addition to the application’s default permissions."
