            (Required) The number of bytes from the beginning of the line following the keyword stream to the last byte just before the keyword endstream. (There may be an additional EOL marker, preceding endstream, that is not included in the count and is not logically part of the stream data.) See

            (Optional) A parameter dictionary or an array of such dictionaries, used by the filters specified by Filter. If there is only one filter and that filter has parameters, DecodeParmsshall be set to the filter’s parameter dictionary unless all the filter’s parameters have their default values, in which case the DecodeParms entry may be omitted. If there are multiple filters and any of the filters has parameters set to nondefault values, DecodeParms shall be an array with one entry for each filter: either the parameter dictionary for that filter, or the null object if that filter has no parameters (or if all of its parameters have their default values). If none of the filters have parameters, or if all their parameters have default values, the DecodeParms entry may be omitted.

            1.2) The file containing the stream data. If this entry is present, the bytes between stream and endstreamshall be ignored. However, the Length entry should still specify the number of those bytes (usually, there are no bytes and Length is 0). The filters that are applied to the file data shall be specified by FFilter and the filter parameters shall be specified by FDecodeParms.
