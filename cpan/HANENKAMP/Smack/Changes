v0.2.0	2019-03-09

    * Improve the content-length() function in Smack::Util so that it does not
      consume the supply. Provides a :defer option to allow the response to the
      calculation to be performed upon completion of the entity rather than
      looping through the output twice.

v0.1.2	2019-03-05

    * Fixing broken META
    * Adding a META test

v0.1.1	2019-03-04

    * Removed some experimental packages that are not read and maybe never will
      be because they were experimental. They were not finished and did not work.
    * Adding a test to make sure all included modules at least compile.

v0.1.0	2019-03-03

    * Adds caching of content when pulling it with the .raw-content or .content
      methods.
    * Fixed bugs in the t/001-request.t test

v0.0.2	2019-03-01
