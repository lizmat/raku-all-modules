Possible future features
========================

handle real numbers (i.e., signed and fractional)

allow addition and subtraction between two numbers with different bases (as
  long as no negative number will result)
  (note that Perl 6 already allows that between decimal, octal, binary,
  and hexadecimal numbers)

handle bases 37 through 62 (and possibly variants, see Wikipedia) [DONE] 

add named param to add 'base-X' to a transformed number (position?)

add bases higher than 62 with named digit sets

allow user-defined digit sets

add a Number class with defined operators +, -, div, mod, /, %, **, *
