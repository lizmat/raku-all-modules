consider changing to check ip version inside other functions and not

modify create md so sig lines are collected and then folded (user has
  opted for such on the CLI) (DONE)

be sure and report if sig lines are too long if user has opted out (DONE)

  ip-bintoip) (DONE)

add suitable tags to META6.json (DONE)

ask for comments from #perl6 (pending receipt of comments...) (DONE)

  (particularly in utility functions) (DONE)

put base conversion and other utility functions in separate export
  category: util (DONE)

export all subs (and test them) (DONE)

for base conversions (except single-character ones) make sure
  generated size is okay (pad left with zeroes if necessary) (DONE)
