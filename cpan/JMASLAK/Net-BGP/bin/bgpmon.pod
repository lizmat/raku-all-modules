=head1 NAME

bgpmon - BGP Monitoring Script

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # bgpmon.pl6 --port=1179 -my-asn=65000 --my-bgp-id=192.0.2.9 \
         192.168.150.252 65000

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides an interface to receive and send BGP update message from a
command line script.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 RECEIVE ROUTES FROM PEER

To see real-time BGP announcements from a peer:

  # bgpmon.pl6 --my-asn=65000 --my-bgp-id=192.0.2.9 192.168.150.252 65000

=head2 ANNOUNCING TO A PEER

To announce a prefix to a peer:

  # bgpmon.pl6 --my-asn=65000 --my-bgp-id=192.0.2.9 \
        --announce=192.0.2.0/24-192.0.2.9
        192.168.150.252 65000

This will connect to 192.168.150.252 and send prefix 192.0.2.0/24 with a
next-hop of 192.0.2.9.

=head1 REQUIRED PARAMETERS

=head2 --my-asn=<asn>

This is our ASN value.

=head2 --my-bgp-id=<ip>

This is our BGP identifier, expressed as an IPv4 address.  Typically this is an
IP address assigned to this host.

=head2 <peer-IP> <peer-ASN>

The last items on the command line are the peers to which we connect and from
which we accept connections.

=head1 OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

=head2 --passive

If this is provided, the script will not attempt to connect to the BGP peers.
Instead, it will simply await connections.

=head2 --port=<port>

This is the BGP port to listen on.  The default port, 179, requires elevated
privileges, so this may be useful for user-level BGP code.

=head2 --listen-host=<host>

This is the BGP host to listen on.  The default host, 0.0.0.0, is equivilent
to "all IPv4 addresses."  Use C<::> if you would like to listen to IPv6 too.

=head2 --allow-unknown-peers

If this is present, peers that aren't explictly defined will be allowed to
connect.  We'll accept whatever ASN they provide on the initial connection
(this initial ASN value will be remembered until this script exits).  This is
useful to minimize configuration requirements.

=head2 --cidr-filter <cidr-list>

This is a comma seperated lists of CIDRS.  If an UPDATE message is received
that has an NRLI or withdrawn/unreachable prefix from this list, the UPDATE
will be printed.  Otherwise it will be silently ignored.  The default is to
have no filtering.

=head2 --announce <prefixs-and-nexthops>

  --announce 192.0.2.0/24-192.0.2.1,10.0.0.0/8-192.0.2.1

A comma seperated list of prefixes to announce along with the appropriate next
hop.  The next hop is seperated from the prefix by a hypen, while multiple
prefixes are seperated by a comma.

=head2 --communities <community-list>

A comma seperated list of communities to advertise with any C<--announce>
routes provided.

=head2 --af-ipv6

If present, advertise address family IPv6 Unicast support to the remote peer.

=head2 --short-format

If present, use the short output format rather than the more human-readable
format. The short format is pipe seperated and contains lines in the following
format:

For OPEN messages, a typical line looks like:

  O|15466360000|192.0.2.2

The fields are "O" (Open), followed by a Posix time stamp, followed by the
peer that sent the Open message.

For UPDATE messages, a typical line looks like:
  
  U|15466360000|192.0.2.2|192.0.2.0/24|192.0.2.2|65001 i|65001:123 65001:345

The fields are "U" (Update), followed by a Posix time stamp, followed by the
peer's IP address, followed by the CIDR announced, followed by the next hop,
followed by the full AS path plus origin, and ending with a list of
space-seperated communities in the BGP message.

=head2 --max-log-messages=<num>

This will cause the C<bgpmon> script to exit after a certain number of messages
are output.

=head2 --batch-size

Decoding the BGP messages is done with a multi-threaded process.  This selects
how many messages should be processed per thread.
