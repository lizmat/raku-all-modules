=head1 Synopsis

    use v6;
    use Benchmark;

    my ($start,$end,$diff,$avg) = timethis(1000, "code");
    my @stats = timethis(1000, sub { #`( code ) });
    say ~@stats;

    my %results = timethese(1000, {
        "foo" => sub { ... },
        "bar" => sub { ... },
    });
    say ~%results;

=head1 Description

A simple benchmarking module with an interface similar to Perl 5's
Benchmark.pm.  However, rather than output results to $*OUT, the results
are merely returned so that you can output them however you please.
