Math::Trig
==========

Subroutines for coverting between degrees, radians, and gradians;
converting between different coordinate systems (cartesian, spherical,
cylindrical); and great circle formulas

SYNOPSIS
===========

    use Math::Trig;

DESCRIPTION
===========

BUGS
====

* This is a work in progress.  Caveat emptor.
* Perhaps rename this module since it's less about trigonometry and more
  about angular conversions and great circles?

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

This module is shamelessly based on the [Perl
5 module](https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::Trig) of the same name.
Without the authors and maintainers of *that* module, this module
wouldn't exist in this form.
