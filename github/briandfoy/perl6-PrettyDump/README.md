# The Perl 6 PrettyDump module

When you want to look at your Perl 6 data structure, you probably want
something nicer than `.perl` or `.gist`.



## Installation

Install it with [zef](https://github.com/ugexe/zef), which comes with
the latest [Rakudo Star](http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/):

	zef install PrettyDump

You can also checkout the [latest sources](https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-PrettyDump) then install from that directory:

	zef install .

## Contributing

Fork the [perl6-PrettyDump](https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-PrettyDump), edit, commit, and send a pull request!

If it's something non-trivial, you might consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/briandfoy/perl6-PrettyDump/issues) first.
