0.4.2 Bugfix a length can be a percentage quantity
- Also reinstate t/terms.t, lost around 538f043
0.4.1 Output a specific unit for zero quantities.
- For example the as for length '0' is now :px(0) rather than :length(0).
0.4.0 Added rule declarations.
- It's now possible to define rules for sharing between properties. For example
      <voice-family> := male | female | child

- Choices now have left-precedence
  for example: 'font-family'	[ <generic-family> | <family-name> ]#
  will resolve as a generic-family in preference to a family name

0.3.2 Starting adding property checks:
- If a property has edges, there should be exactly four
- All children of an edge property, should also be edges
0.3.1 Preserve declaration order of child properties in metadata
0.3.0 Distinguish 'edge' and 'child' properties
- A four sided propert has 'edges'. E.g. 'border' has
  'border-top', ... 'border-left'
- A compound property has children. E.g. 'background' has 'background-color',
  'background-attachment', 'background-image', ...
0.2.2 Include subproperties in meta childern.
- E.g. "cue" now has child properties "cue-before", "cue-after"
- These are distinguished from "box" properties by not having the :box flag set.
