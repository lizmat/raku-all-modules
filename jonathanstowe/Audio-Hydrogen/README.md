# Audio::Hydrogen

Work with Hydrogen songs and drumkits

## Synopsis

```perl6

use Audio::Hydrogen;

for Audio::Hydrogen.new.drumkits -> $dk {
    say $dk.name;
}

```

There are also some vaguely useful examples in the [examples](examples)
directory.

## Description

This provides the facilities for creating and manipulating drumkit and
song data of the [Hydrogen](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/) drum software.

I originally wrote this with no other purpose than as a test for
[XML::Class](https://github.com/jonathanstowe/XML-Class) so it may well
be missing some features that you would like to see, but please see the
examples for things that you can do with it.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working Rakudo Perl 6 installation you should be able to
install this with *panda* :

    # From the source directory
   
    panda install .

    # Remote installation

    panda install Audio::Hydrogen

I haven't tried this with *zef* but I have no reason to think it
shouldn't work if you would rather use that.

Other install mechanisms may be become available in the future.

## Support

I'm sure this is almost certainly missing some useful features,
and am quite open to any ideas that could make it more useful.

I'd also be delighted to hear about anything interesting you
do with it.

Suggestions/patches are welcomed via github at
