# HTTP::HPACK

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jnthn/p6-http-hpack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jnthn/p6-http-hpack)

## Synopsis

Decoding:

    my $decoder = HTTP::HPACK::Decoder.new;
    my @headers = $decoder.decode-headers($buf);
    say "{.name}: {.value} ({.indexing})" for @headers;

Encoding:

    my @headers = 
        HTTP::HPACK::Header.new(
            name  => ':method',
            value => 'GET'
        ),
        HTTP::HPACK::Header.new(
            name     => 'password',
            value    => 'correcthorsebatterystaple',
            indexing => HTTP::HPACK::Indexing::NeverIndexed
        );
    my $encoder = HTTP::HPACK::Encoder.new;
    my $buf = $encoder.encode-headers(@headers);

## Description

HPACK is the HTTP/2 header compression algorithm. This module implements encoding
(compression) and decoding (decompression) of the HPACK format, as specified in
RFC 7541. A HTTP/2 connection will typically have an instance of the decoder (to
decompress incoming headers) and an instance of the encoder (to compress outgoing
headers).

## Notes on specific features

### Huffman compression

Decoding of headers compressed using the Huffman codes (set out in the RFC) takes
place automatically. By default, the encoder will not apply Huffman compression.
To enable this, construct it with the `huffman` option set to `True`:

    my $encoder = HTTP::HPACK::Encoder.new(:huffman);

### Dynamic table management

The dynamic table size can be limited by passing the `dynamic-table-limit` option
when constructing either the encoder or decoder:

    my $decoder = HTTP::HPACK::Decoder.new(dynamic-table-limit => 256);

It is also possible to introspect the current dynamic table size:

    say $decoder.dynamic-table-size;

The size is computed according to the algorithm in RFC 7541 Section 4.1.

## Thread safety

Instances of HTTP::HPACK::Header are immutable and so safe to share and access
concurrently. Instances of HTTP::HPACK::Decoder and HTTP::HPACK::Encoder are
stateful (as a result of the dynamic table), and so a given instance may not be
used concurrently. This is not a practical problem, since headers may only be
processed in the order they are being received or transmitted anyway.

## Known issues

* The dynamic table size change instruction is not yet implemented.
* The Huffman code termination handling has not been validated to be completely
  up to specification, and so may fail to signal errors in some cases where the
  Huffman code is terminated in a bogus way.
